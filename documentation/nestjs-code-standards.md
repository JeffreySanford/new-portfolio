# NestJS Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for NestJS projects within this repository. These guidelines aim to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality code across the entire codebase.

## 1. General NestJS Coding Standards

### 1.1 Project Structure

- Follow the NestJS CLI’s default structure for organizing modules, controllers, services, and other assets.
- Group related files together, keeping a clear separation of concerns (e.g., `controllers`, `services`, `models`, etc.).
- **Why Use Modules?**: 
  - **Encapsulation**: Modules allow you to encapsulate and manage specific functionalities of the application. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand, especially as the application grows.
  - **Scalability**: In enterprise applications, features tend to evolve independently. Modules allow for clear separation of concerns, enabling teams to work on different parts of the application without causing conflicts.
  - **Lazy Loading**: NestJS modules can be lazily loaded, meaning that parts of the application are only loaded when needed. This improves the application's performance by reducing the initial load time.
  - **Reusability**: Modules can be easily reused across different parts of the application or even in different projects. This promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and code reusability.

### 1.2 Naming Conventions

- **Controllers**: Use `PascalCase` for controller class names and `kebab-case` for filenames (e.g., `UserController` class in `user.controller.ts`).
- **Services**: Use `PascalCase` for service class names and append `Service` to the name (e.g., `AuthService` in `auth.service.ts`).
- **Modules**: Use `PascalCase` for module names and append `Module` to the name (e.g., `UserModule`).
- **Entities**: Use `PascalCase` for entity class names and `kebab-case` for filenames (e.g., `UserEntity` in `user.entity.ts`).

### 1.3 Controller Design

- Keep controllers small and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Use services to encapsulate business logic and data access.
- Prefer using dependency injection to manage service instances.

## 2. RxJS and Observables

### 2.1 Usage

- Prefer using `Observables` over `Promises` for asynchronous operations.
- Use the `async` pipe in templates to handle subscription management for simple subscriptions (cold observables).
- For hot observables, explicitly handle subscriptions using the `next`, `error`, and `complete` methods in the component to gain more control over debugging and to handle complex scenarios.
- Developers must be diligent in managing subscriptions for hot observables to avoid memory leaks.

### 2.2 Why Use Observables Over Promises/Async?

- **Multiple Values**: Unlike Promises, which handle only a single value, Observables can handle a stream of multiple values over time. This makes them ideal for scenarios like handling user input, web socket data, or any event-based data streams.
- **Composability**: Observables are composable and can be combined, transformed, and filtered using operators like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more. This allows for more powerful and expressive asynchronous code.
- **Cancellation**: Observables allow for easy cancellation of ongoing asynchronous operations through the use of subscriptions. With Promises, cancellation is not natively supported, which can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.
- **Consistency with NestJS**: NestJS's HttpModule, WebSocketGateway, and many other APIs are built on top of Observables. Using Observables consistently across the application aligns with NestJS’s design principles and makes the code more coherent and maintainable.
- **Error Handling**: Observables provide more flexible error handling mechanisms with operators like `catchError` and `retry`, allowing developers to handle errors more gracefully and according to different scenarios.
- **Cold vs. Hot Observables**:
  - For **cold observables**, the `async` pipe in the template is preferred because it handles the subscription and unsubscription automatically, simplifying the component code.
  - For **hot observables**, using the `next`, `error`, and `complete` methods within the component is beneficial for debugging and managing more complex data streams. Developers should ensure that these subscriptions are properly managed and unsubscribed to prevent memory leaks.

## 3. Database Interaction

### 3.1 Usage of TypeORM

- Prefer using TypeORM for database interactions to leverage its powerful ORM capabilities.
- Define entities using TypeORM decorators and follow the naming conventions for entities.
- Use repositories to encapsulate database access logic and keep it separate from business logic.

### 3.2 Entity Design

- Keep entities small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use TypeORM’s relations to define relationships between entities.
- **Importance of DTOs**: 
  - **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** are crucial for transferring data between different layers of the application. They help ensure type safety, data validation, and a clear contract for data exchange.
  - DTOs help in maintaining a clean architecture by decoupling the internal data structures from the external data representation.
  - Using DTOs can prevent over-fetching or under-fetching of data, as they allow you to specify exactly what data is needed for a particular operation.

## 4. Error Handling

### 4.1 Global Error Handling

- Use NestJS’s built-in exception filters to handle errors globally.
- Define custom exception filters for specific error handling scenarios.
- Ensure that all errors are logged appropriately for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### 4.2 Validation

- Use class-validator and class-transformer to validate and transform incoming data.
- Define DTOs with validation decorators to ensure data integrity and type safety.

## 5. Security

### 5.1 Authentication and Authorization

- Use NestJS’s built-in AuthModule to handle authentication and authorization.
- Prefer using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
- Define roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the application.

### 5.2 Data Protection

- Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration data and avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.
- **FedRAMP and NIST RMF Auditing**:
  - **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)** and **NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)** are critical for ensuring that your application meets stringent security and compliance requirements.
  - Implementing FedRAMP and NIST RMF standards helps in protecting sensitive data, managing risks, and ensuring that the application is secure and compliant with federal regulations.
  - Regular auditing and adherence to these frameworks can prevent security breaches and ensure that the application is resilient against potential threats.

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Unit Testing

- Use Jest as the testing framework for unit tests.
- Write unit tests for all services, controllers, and other critical parts of the application.
- Ensure that tests are isolated and do not depend on external systems.

### 6.2 Integration Testing

- Write integration tests to test the interaction between different parts of the application.
- Use a test database to ensure that integration tests do not affect the production database.
- Ensure that integration tests cover all critical use cases and scenarios.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 API Documentation

- Use Swagger to generate API documentation automatically.
- Ensure that all endpoints are documented with appropriate descriptions, parameters, and response types.
- Keep the API documentation up to date with the latest changes in the codebase.

### 7.2 Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments to document functions, classes, and methods.
- Ensure that all public APIs are documented with appropriate descriptions and examples.
- Keep the code documentation up to date with the latest changes in the codebase.
