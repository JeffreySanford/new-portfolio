# New Portfolio - Backend

This is the backend server for my personal portfolio, built with NestJS. It handles API requests, serves dynamic content, and integrates with OpenAI to enhance the user experience through voice-guided navigation and recommendations.

## Features

- **NestJS Framework**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.
- **API-Driven Architecture**: The backend serves as an API layer, providing content and data to the frontend via RESTful endpoints.
- **OpenAI Integration**: 
  - The backend integrates with OpenAI to generate dynamic content based on user interactions. 
  - It provides summaries of different sections of the portfolio and suggests next steps, creating a more engaging and personalized user experience.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Designed with security and scalability in mind, using best practices in Node.js and NestJS.
